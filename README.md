# Digital Marketing Campaign Case Study – PostgreSQL
Introduction: 
In this digital marketing case study, we will analyze the performance of various marketing campaigns across multiple platforms like Google Ads and Facebook Ads. The goal is to derive actionable insights from customer engagement data, including metrics like impressions, clicks, conversions, and ad spend. 
By leveraging SQL queries, we’ll evaluate campaign effectiveness, customer behavior, and platform performance, helping to optimize marketing strategies. The analysis will focus on key KPIs like cost-per-click (CPC), return on investment (ROI), and customer lifetime value.
